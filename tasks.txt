done:
1. make the title more prominent
2. move burn % to be first - and make his title and content be bigger font
3. remove - maybe unnessery card that was wrapping the data on the front page
4. total supply distribution pie chart - using the https://jsinfo.lavanet.xyz/supply/total endpoint
5. fixed daily burn amount number - added tooltip 'Daily burn amount in LAVA'

waiting for oren:
1. value for "Revenue (distributed to LAVA stackers)"
2. daily burn rate amounts chart - save this daily - and then diff him?. link: https://jsinfo.lavanet.xyz/supply/total
3. Revenue distribution to lava stackers section - where do i get this info



should stackers includes delegators - 

Do the stackers include both provider and validators - or only providers ?
should i include delegators ?

validators - dont know - oren needs to check if it's possible 
delegators - it's harder (task) - just to make sure if this is nessery before we do it


this:
upplies = await cosmosClient.bank.v1beta1.totalSupply();
i can already query by height and have diff of days




future:
how to do over endpoint : 'Burn % of total supply'
